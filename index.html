            <p>I Will Survive
                Gloria Gaynor
                At first I was afraid, I was petrified
                Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
                But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
                And I grew strong
                And I learned how to get along
                And so you're back
                From outer space
                I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
                I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key
                If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
                Go on now, go, walk out the door
                Just turn around now
                'Cause you're not welcome anymore
                Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
                Do you think I'd crumble
                Did you think I'd lay down and die?
                Oh no, not I, I will survive
                Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
                I've got all my life to live…
